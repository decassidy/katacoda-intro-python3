### What is regular expression?

A regular expression (abbr as **regex** or **regexp**) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-search algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. 

`mkdir step2 && cd step2 && touch step2-regex.py`{{execute}}

<pre class="file" data-filename="./step2/step2-regex.py" data-target="append">import re</pre>
